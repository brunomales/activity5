/*
 * Class for a simple computer based weather station that reports the current
 * temperature (in Celsius) every second. The station is attached to a
 * sensor that reports the temperature as a 16-bit number (0 to 65535)
 * representing the Kelvin temperature to the nearest 1/100th of a degree.
 *
 * This class is implements Runnable so that it can be embedded in a Thread
 * which runs the periodic sensing.
 *
 * The class also extends Observable so that it can notify registered
 * objects whenever its state changes. Convenience functions are provided
 * to access the temperature in different schemes (Celsius, Kelvin, etc.)
